        <li>1 cup (240g) sliced mushrooms</li>
        <li>1/4 cup (60ml) brandy or cognac (optional)</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon cornstarch mixed with 2 tablespoons water (optional, for thickening)</li>
        <li>1/4 cup (60g) chopped parsley, for garnish</li>
    </ul>
    <p></p>
        
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat the olive oil in a large skillet or frying pan over medium-high heat.</li>
        <li>Add the chopped onion and cook until translucent, about 3-4 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add the minced garlic and cook for another 1-2 minutes, until fragrant.</li>
        <li>Season the chicken pieces with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Add the chicken to the skillet and cook until browned on all sides, about 5-7 minutes.</li>
        <li>Stir in the Dijon mustard, ketchup, and Worcestershire sauce.</li>
        <li>Add the sliced mushrooms and cook until they start to soften, about 3-4 minutes.</li>
        <li>Pour in the brandy or cognac, if using, and cook until the alcohol evaporates, about 1-2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add the tomato sauce, chicken broth, and heavy cream, stirring to combine.</li>
        <li>Reduce the heat to medium-low and let the mixture simmer for about 10-15 minutes, allowing the flavors to meld and the sauce to thicken.</li>
        <li>If the sauce is too thin, stir in the cornstarch mixed with water to thicken it to your desired consistency.</li>
        <li>Stir in the butter until melted and well combined.</li>
        <li>Taste and adjust the seasoning with more salt and pepper if needed.</li>
        <li>Serve the chicken strogonoff hot, garnished with chopped parsley. Accompany with white rice and a generous serving of potato sticks on the side.</li>
